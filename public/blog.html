            <h1>Ups and Downs of Getting in Shape for Golf</h1>
            <p>
                I am about 3 weeks into dedicated fitness training with the focus of losing weight, building strength, and improving stamina. I've been stepping out about 3 miles a day; some of it walking, and most of it jogging. I've broken my weeks up to focus on different
                muscle groups to work through calisthenics and basic bar bell exercises. The idea being <b>get in shape from home and save gym membership money for more time on the course.</b><br><br> But honestly, it has been painful
                at times. The other day I finished up my run and asked myself, "Is this my life now? Spending about an hour a day trying to run around my neighborhood?"
                <br><br> So far, I feel motivated and I have been losing weight steadily. My diet is shifting to reflect my efforts, and I feel good about that also. With about 20 pounds to lose before my goal weight, I know things are going to get more
                difficult, but I feel myself getting stronger. Right now I feel on track to get to where I want to be, but I'm fearful that I won't know how to adapt my routine when it becomes necessary.<br><br> Ultimately I know these habits can have
                a serious effect on my life that could allow me to stick around a bit longer for my family, and maybe get some more golf in before I kick the bucket, and I remind myself <b>that I have about 5 months to get to where I want to be.</b> So
                far the biggest payoff seems to be strength and endurance I can feel. I have certainly missed endorphin rushes, and the time for self-reflection that running brings.<b><i> So my hope is that in 3 months I won't ask if habitually running is my life now, rather, I'll be bothered by the days I don't have time 
                to get out to do so.</i></b><br><br>Whether or not getting in shape will pay off on the course has yet to be seen, but I can already feel improved confidence in my swing at the range, and I am feeling a better sense of my body. Those things
                combined with putting the time in at the pitch and putt have me hopeful that all this will pay off. Seeing guys like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau">Bryson DeChambeau</a> and how he approaches the game give me
                some extra motivation also.<br><br>

            <h1>Mat Etiquette</h1>
            <p>
                WARNING: This post is mostly me venting.<br><br>I implore all golfers who spend time at driving ranges to be considerate of the people beside them. Last night I went to a nearby range to get some practice in before they turned the lights
                off. Things started off great, I got a spot under the lights that I perceived as one that would offer a little bit of privacy. On one side of me was a ledge where another golfer might be above me if they took the spot, but wouldn't really
                be a distraction. On the other side of me were mats that sit under a canopy and are essentially in the dark at night. With so many other mats under the light, I wouldn't imagine anyone willfully hitting in the dark... but my imagination
                is not an accurate depiction of reality.<br><br> After hitting about two dozen balls with an unusual consistency I heard two things that always annoy the crap out of me. The first thing was the crunch of gravel, but this crunch was isolated,
                not the crunch of passerby's headed to their mat. This crunch was from a middle aged couple deciding they were going to set up camp in the shaded area behind me; which leads me to my second hated nuisance, TALKING while I swing. Don't
                get me wrong, I am not expecting too much at a driving range, and none of this was all that bothersome at first; but I still had about 60 balls left and the couple next to me seemed oblivious to anyone around them. <br><br> As I continued
                through my bucket, the two next to me started swinging and continued to talk. Their chat continued as the man attempted to give guidance, "Just let the club do the work", to which his partner countered, "What about my hips? Aren't I supposed
                to open my hips with this club?"<br><br> Before I knew it I was only focusing on the chatter beside me, and wondering about my hips. Were my shots becoming inconsistent because I was making the same mistakes as that lady? I kept taking
                breaks to try and regain focus, but while I sat back for a few moments, the chatter persisted and I realized this was going to be the case for the rest of my session unless I said something. I said nothing, and tried to use it as some
                practice drill. Surely if I could get my swing going with bullshit banter beside me, it would improve my game, no? It was a futile effort, and I just became frustrated as the clinic next to me continued. Meanwhile, there were all these
                open spaces nearby with plenty of light for this couple or myself to take instead; but they were rude and dumb enough not to take them from the onset, and I was too prideful not to take it when I realized they were presenting a problem
                for me.<br><br>Lessons learned, <b>bring ear plugs to the range</b> and some people will never consider these things, because maybe they don't bother them like they do me. Also, you learn what clubs you are better in the scenario I described;
                and I'm getting more excited about my long game based on the consistency and accuracy I am finding with my driver and my woods.<br><br>

            <h1>Group Generated Tournaments?</h1>
            <p>
                Recently I joined a Facebook group for golfers in my small state, and since I joined it has grown by about 800 people and counting. It made me think back to a few years ago putting together a charity golf tournament to raise funds for a couple charities.
                I had a really hard time connecting with golfers, and even though I paid for some Facebook advertising, hardly anyone showed up.<br><br> That might sound a little pitiful, but the experience paired with what I am seeing
                now makes me think that a strong Facebook group could organize charitable golf tournaments and lure advertisers based on a large projected turnout early on. How many people does it really take to have a worthwhile event where everyone
                has fun and contributes to a good cause? Even with potentially lower turnouts because of Covid culture, if you project things properly for such an event, you can make the most of it for everyone.<br>

            <h1>Why Pull-Carts Rule</h1>
            <p>My first takeaway from playing with a pullcart was how accessible all my items were. You might be surprised how much time is saved by not having to walk around a driving cart for things. The second thing I noticed, was all the new routes I
                could take to get from point A to point B. Since you can essentially roll around wherever, without the consequence of 'Cart-Path Only' you can actually get to your ball quicker in some situations, and you might see things you otherwise
                would not. Lastly, getting the added exercise that comes from walking is a great way to get in shape.<br><br>On the flip side, if you are out of shape, you may find things to be miserable after a few holes; and this can be compounded by
                making the mistake of walking a course that is less than ideal for walking. Weather as always, is an issue when golfing also, so if you're planning on walking, you need to be even more considerate of weather, and not just on the day of.
                You will quickly pickup on weather from the previous days if you head out on a sunny day only to find that the course is soggy.<br><br>
                <h3>My Recommendations Before Walking a Course:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Find out if the course is reasonable for walking(they are not all suitable, and some do not allow it)</li>
                    <li>Bring extra socks whether your shoes are waterproof or not</li>
                    <li>Pack what you normally would, but be extra prepared for that day's weather and whatever the previous days weather may have left behind</li>
                    <li>Drink extra water beforehand, and bring extra water along</li>
                    <li>Do not walk unless your body is prepared to walk 3-6 miles or more</li>
                    <li>Be prepared to pay a higher price for bad shots with added steps(if you get frustrated normally, walking probably won't help)</li>
                </ol>

                <img src="jpg/s_game.jpg">
                <p>I could not sleep last night, because I started watching a documentary on Netflix called 'The Short Game'. If you haven't seen it, it's about talented young golfers competing in the Kid's Golf World Championship.<br><br> Impressive would
                    be an understatement for what the kids do out on the course, and their drive for the game is exceptional. The film is 7 years old at this point, so most of the kids in the film have doubled their ages by now and are finding continued
                    success in the sport.<br><br> The reason I am posting about the film is because it is golf related, and there is a lot of golf wisdom to be had throughout. It will be fun to keep an eye out for these kids on the tour now that they're
                    getting closer to that point; one of the young ladies featured recently made her LPGA tour debut and it seems clear that golf success is her destiny.<br><b>10/2/2020</b></p>

            <h1>Offseason / 2020 Recap</h1>
            <p>The Coronavirus has changed many things, and for me it has led to more golf. This summer I spent more time working on my swing and walking courses than I have since I started golfing 20 years ago, but I still faced the same issues that have
                always plagued my game, along with new issues that have come with age and lifestyle. Also, the first day of quarantine my wife informed me we were expecting a baby in October, so other things are changing, and that's why my 'offseason'
                is starting before November. My new baby boy is added incentive to improve myself in some of the ways I detail that are not strictly related to golf. Hopefully in a few years I will have my kids out walking courses with me and showing
                me up.<br><br> The things that have always hampered my game will require time and effort to remedy, but the obstacles that age and lifestyle have presented require a more concerted effort, determination, and patience every single day(on
                and off the course). So this is the first year I am actually thinking of Winter as a golf offseason, and my goal is to improve my general fitness in that time while also working on muscle groups that will improve my swing. My hope is that
                when Spring 2021 comes around, I'll have shed some weight, improved my conditioning, and strengthened my golf game in the process. Granted, I will also need to practice, but I have a plan that I think will keep my 'skills' intact.<br><br>                Before digging into what I plan on doing to improve my game whilst preparing for next Spring, I'd like to talk more about the last few months and how my approaches have changed. <i>The first thing</i> that stands out when considering where
                I have changed is in seeking help. I finally started watching swing tutorials to help figure out where I was going wrong, and this led to some big improvements in driving and putting. There is still much room for improvement, and some
                personal guidance is probably necessary, so one of my goals next year is to get a session or two of coaching and swing analysis.<br><br> Another notable area of change, is that I bought a pullcart and have begun walking courses. Along
                the way, I started filming my swing and practicing for vlogging next year.<br><br> Finally, I began keeping my score and being honest with myself about where I am at versus where I want to be at when it comes to golf. I feel I have done
                some things that are absolutely necessary in making improvements by charting the biggest areas of need. Since I started<br><br>Moving forward my first objective is to get in better shape and stay committed to keeping myself there. I will
                never be able to walk a course and maintain a score below 95 if I am out of shape; and I'll never enjoy the game walking if it's a chore every time I go out. I need to get in better shape if I am going to play better golf for a longer
                period of time. My short game needs a lot of work also, so I will be spending a lot more time chipping the next few months, and I have created a time slot to accommodate that at least once a week at a par-3 course nearby.<br><br><b>9/30/2020</b>
