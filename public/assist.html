    <h1><b>Scoring and Assists:</b></h1>
    <p>This page looks at top players based on scoring and assists. The top chart includes the top 50 players based on scoring and looks 
      at their point scoring, rebound, and assist statistics.
    </p>
    <p>The chart at the bottom gives a brief look into assist leaders alone and was not used further. It should be considered 
      as a sketch for this project, as it was made early on when looking at data, and was more a way of getting acclimated with 
      the library <a href="https://canvasjs.com/">Canvasjs</a>.

      <p>The chart above has been formatted with a sorting method. The players represented in the graphic are each ranked in the top 50
         scoreres in the history of the NBA. The sorting method allows you to see how these 50 players also rank against one another in 
         the categories of assists and rebounds.
         <br>
         This was an attempt to not just look at the data, but to manipulate it and craft it for consumption. A basketball enthusiast 
         could look at this chart and have lots of fun comparing historical players. An improved version might allow for a search function.
