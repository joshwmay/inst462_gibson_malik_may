            <h1><u>Reviews</u></h1>
            <p>On this page I review items that I have recently purchased, used, or been given. I will not be reviewing any of my irons because I have had the same one's for so long. However, when and if I acquire new one's I will give my input. <br><br>                This feels a little ambitious to put out, but I have included a Wish-List link below for things I would love to review.

                <p>I got these shoes knowing I was going to start walking courses when possible, and I am happy I did. They feel more like grippy running shoes than golf shoes I'm accustomed to, and are lightweight. Where they fall short is when countered
                    with wetter outings. That's why I bring extra socks <a href="blog.html#socks"><u>as noted in a recent blog</u></a><br><br> Now that I have walked a couple courses in them, I am even more excited to ride one day, because they are the
                    most comfortable golf shoes I have ever owned, and that <i>could</i> be a game changer; and if not, at least I know my feet won't hurt at the end of the day.

            <h1><a href="https://bit.ly/2GPdXje">Taylormade M6 Driver</a></h1>
            <div class="row">
                <img src="jpg/m6.JPG">
                <p>This driver was released in 2019 and was hyped as Taylormade's fastest driver. They evidently had not previously attempted to come close to breaking any PGA rules regarding club speed, and honestly I don't know what that means. What I
                    do know, is that the club was a needed upgrade for me, and I notice a tremendous difference between it and the driver I had been using.<br><br> The club has 3 loft options, but I have left it on standard because it already has surprising
                    loft at that setting. The balance of this driver makes me feel powerful every time I pull it out of the bag, and it's the first driver I have worked with that feels responsive to where I am aiming. The draw you can get from this club
                    is mesmerizing with a clean hit, and I have lost at least two balls that I simply lost sight of on the fairway that appeared straight... that may be more of a commentary on my vision, or may be the result of the work of ball thieving
                    squirrels.
                    <br><br> If you are in the position I was when I got this club, having used a decades old driver, you will not be disappointed.
