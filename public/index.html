            <p>Welcome to my golf blog! First and foremost, I am on a mission to have at least one round of golf below 90 in my lifetime, and I started this site as a way to document my 'golf journey'. My hope, is that in doing so, I will improve my game,
                become more knowledgable on the sport, and have something to anchor my motivation with. I will detail my thoughts and approaches to the game while marking off a bucket list of courses I plan on playing in my area. <br><br> Additionally,
                I will be documenting future golf outings, while reviewing places I've played, and products I have used. Since I am not the most experience or knowledgable, I will provide an email address for inquiring minds to ask questions and give
                commentary.

            <h2>My Golf Roots</h2>
            <p>I have been hitting golf balls since I was about 10 years old, when my grandfather handed me a 9-iron and told me to go try and hit some balls in the field behind his home.
                <b><i>I don't recall finding much success</i></b> until my Pop-Pop came out and gave some guidance. The first thing I remember him explaining, was to <b>keep my head down</b>
                </b> and <b>focus on the back of the ball</b> throughout the swing. He was very patient with me, and went over <i>keeping the left arm straight</i> and <i>keeping the right elbow in</i>. After those things started coming together, he attempted
                to teach me to let the club do the work, breathe a certain way, and let go of distractions. <br><br> I have had lessons from other instructors, but none of them have stuck with me as much as the things my grandfather taught me, and the
                honest truth is, the things I focus on when I play are usually the things he taught me, and any improvements I've seen are merely tweaking or reinforcing what I learned 20 years ago. . . I am however, still working on getting below 100
                consistently, but the commitment is there.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
            <p>My relationship with golf has been inconsistent. I enjoy playing, but have had years where I play 5 or more times, and others where I did not play at all since I started. You can see by the <a href="#mapid">map</a> the different places I've
                played and the ones I would like to(along with links to their webpages if you're interested in booking a tee time). By far, the most enjoyable place I have gotten to play, is San Diego. The US Navy allowed me to play some unforgettable
                places, and San Diego offered weather I long for most times I hit the cart path back home on the East Coast.<br><br>How I got here today however, has more to do with the last 6 months. During Covid quarantine, I have had more time to rekindle
                things with the sport, and where I currently reside, I have found a great par-3 course and driving range. At some point, I decided to take my clubs down the road and see how my swing was doing. I was surprised that it felt mostly intact
                that day, but I also just enjoyed getting outside in the sun. So I started going more often until I was finding consistency, and then I decided it was time to get out and play a round.<br><br>The first round of the summer started with
                my brother-in-law breaking my driver by accident which had an effect on the whole day. I was not upset since I have a spare and was able to stay positive. I did not keep score, but on the 18th hole I got a birdie on a par-4. It was surprising,
                because I had to make a downhill breaking putt from the fringe in order to get it. That moment added some fuel to my fire, and I started focusing more on what it would take to get more birdies.<br><br>The next time I went out, I parred
                the first two holes of the course and was feeling pretty good before things went downhill quick; but I learned that day, that it's okay to be picky with golf partners, because another person in my party was purposely antagonizing me and
                intentionally talking during my backswing. Uncle or not, that is not cool, and while I can only blame myself for poor play, I felt that it was important to make note of it to avoid inviting that sort of negativity out on the course with
                me again(I stopped keeping score after the 4th hole out of frustration).<br><br> The next time I went out, I contacted an old friend whom I had never golfed with and hadn't seen in almost a decade. We had a lot of fun, and his style of
                golf meshed well with me. I did not play all that well, but I kept a legitimate score for the first time in my life and came out with a 105. After that round however, I found a pullcart because I felt that avoiding cart fees was in my
                interest, and that getting added exercise would be good for me. I went back and played the same course I scored 105 on 2 weeks later, but I walked it. As much as I loved the pullcart, and having instant access to things I needed, I got
                a 105 again. I was proud of the score though, because by hole 10, I was feeling ready to pack it in and call it a day after all the walking I had done.<br><br><b>Getting to the point</b> of now, I realized that getting a memorable score
                in golf would require more from me than simply improving my swing consistency; I would have to improve other things about me to improve at golf. The round I walked and got a 105, my fitbit told me I finished the day with about 24,000 steps(lots
                of par-5's, poor play, and lack of fitness will do it). When I did make it to the 18th hole I was pretty much exhausted and the fun had evaporated for me that day, and fatigue caused me to lose focus and forget the things I had worked
                on for the weeks leading up.<br><br>I am attempting to get better at golf through:
                <ol>
                    <li>Improving fitness</li>
                    <li>Improving consistency</li>
                    <li>Boosting confidence</li>
                    <li>Committing to the first 3 things</li>
                </ol>
                At this point, it's like I'm literally trying to become the best version of myself in order to play the best golf of my life, and there is nothing but intrinsic value to it. Hopefully doing so will set an example for my kids, and they will want to be
                better versions of themselves just because they see me doing it. Maybe they'll want to come walk the course with me at some point.

    <h1><b>Site Description:</b></h1>
    <p>This website has been designed to look at data visualizations using NBA statistics and create a data-driven story with them. 
      This is all en route to the completion of a final group project in a data visualization course at the University of Maryland. 
      Visualizations and analysis have been done using different tools and this website serves to present the work completed. More than 
      anything, our group wanted to make tangible. While an application is not quite the same as Tony Stark helming his operating system, 
      a thumb is now mightier than the pen or the sword.
    </p>
    <p><i><b>Please be aware,</b> this site relies on a <b>'Populate Data'</b> switch that appears in the dropdown/side menu. In order to show the 
      data be sure to check this switch. After clicking, the switch is used for darkmode purposes. . . You may need to click it on each page you open #CodingDeadlines 
    </i></p>
    <h1><b>Dataset Description:</b></h1>
    <p>The dataset used for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/joshwmay/inst462_gibson_malik_may/blob/master/public/csv/master_clean.csv">
      here</a>. This data was obtained from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">basketball-reference.com</a>, but is incomplete.
      This is because the dataset was imperfectly scraped with a focus on breadth. While certain players may be missing that should appear in 
      statistical leader categories, the numbers themselves do belong in the rows of data they appear with; and there is still a story to be told.
    </p> 
    <h1><b>Overview</b></h1>   
    <p>Below are some general visualizations that attempt to encapsulate some general statistics. The portions of this site that contain javascript 
      visualizations appear as seen below, with the interactive visual appearing above a collapsible description.</p>
    <div  id="chart1"></div>
    <div class="butt" id="butt1" onClick="openDesc('1')" title="View Top 50 Players by Games Played Details">
      View Top 50 Players by Games Played Details</div>
    <div class="open" id="open1">
      <p>The chart above displays the top 50 players by games played. Hovering over a given column will display the player name and amount of games 
        they played. Once again, it is important to note that the data used for this site is incomplete; therefor, what is seen above may not reflect 
        actual NBA statistics with 100% accuracy.
      </p>      
      <button onClick="closeDesc('1')">Hide Details</button>

    <div  id="chart3"></div>  
    <div class="butt" id="butt2" onClick="openDesc('2')" title="View League Averages by Debut Year Details">
      View League Averages by Debut Year Details</div>
    <div class="open" id="open2">
      <p>The chart above attempts to visualize wins contributed and points per game in a generational fashion. 
        By grouping players by their debut year, it seemed possible to find out which debut years were the best.
        The negative trend does not reflect the true skill level of players over time, nor does it account for new franchises 
        that have been added over the years(opening the door for more players to debut, and possibly watering down averages).
        <br>
        <b><i>Notably</i></b>, there is a valley at 1998. This is where an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_lockout">NBA lockout</a> occurred, and annotating it has proven 
        beyond the time we have for this project, so hopefully this suffices. 
      </p>
