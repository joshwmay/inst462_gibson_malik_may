      <p>The chart above displays a distribution of all heights that were obtained in creating the dataset. This accounts for nearly 2500
        players in the NBA all-time. 
      </p>
      
      <h1><b>Findings</b></h1>
      <p>The distribution of heights all-time in the NBA appears normal and mildly skewed left. This indicates what most would expect, players that make it tos 
        the NBA tend to be taller. </p>

      <p>This chart shows the height distribution of the top 450 assist(passing the ball to a scorer), rebound(regaining possession
        of a ball after it is shot), and wins contributed(calculation of wins a player contributed) leaders.
      </p>
      <h1><b>Findings</b></h1>
      <p>Both rebounds and assists appear to have normal distributions, there is however, a noticable difference in height distribution between 
        where they peak. Assist leaders heights peak at a height of 75 inches, while rebound leaders heights peak at 81 inches. It certainly 
        makes sense for taller players to be rebound leaders, as they are physically closer to the rim and will often be positioned closer to 
        the basket in order to box-out opposing players and have a better chance to gain possession of the ball. 
      </p>
      <p>Wins contributed is more of a toss-up in this visual. It does not appear to have a quite normal distribution, and it certainly skews
        left. This does not entirely substantiate the claim that taller players lead to more wins, but it is a start in that direction.
